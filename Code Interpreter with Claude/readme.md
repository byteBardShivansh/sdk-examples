# MCP with Claude Code Interpreter

## Overview
A secure and controlled execution environment for running Python code using **Claude (Anthropicâ€™s AI)** with **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** inside **Daytona**.

## Features
- **Code Interpreter**: AI executes Python scripts in a sandboxed environment.
- **Secure Sandboxing**: Isolated execution to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Process Isolation**: Each execution runs in a separate environment.
- **State Persistence**: Maintains execution state across interactions.
- **Real-Time Execution**: Immediate feedback and results for Python scripts.

## How It Works
1. **User provides a Python script**.
2. **Claude AI processes the request** via **MCP**.
3. **Daytona securely runs the code** inside an isolated workspace.
4. **Results are returned** to the user with structured execution details.

## Technology Stack
- **Claude AI (Anthropic)**: Language model for code execution.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Manages memory, tools, and structured reasoning.
- **Daytona SDK**: Provides a secure execution environment.

## Use Case Example
- **Input**: User submits a Python script.
- **Processing**: Claude AI interprets and executes it in Daytona via MCP.
- **Output**: The results are displayed in real-time.
