# Code Commenting Agent (Using SmolAgents)

## Overview
A robust solution for automating code commentary using SmolAgents, an AI agent framework. This agent reads Python code, adds relevant comments, and even generates tests. The system runs inside Daytona SDK for executing Python code in isolated environments, ensuring secure, repeatable, and reproducible interactions.

## Features
- AI-Powered Code Commenting: Automatically adds insightful comments to Python code using SmolAgents.
- Test Generation: AI reads code, understands logic, and generates relevant tests for Python functions.
- Stateful Operations: Tracks context across interactions and stores snapshots for continuity.
- Docker-Compatible: Easily run in Docker environments, ensuring portability and reproducibility.
- Daytona SDK Integration: Runs code in secure, isolated workspaces to maintain environment integrity.

## How It Works
1. User provides Python code (a function or script).
2. SmolAgent processes the code:
3. It analyzes the code, adds comments, and generates tests if applicable.
4. Daytona SDK executes the code in an isolated workspace.
5. The results are returned:
- Includes commented code and test cases along with the execution result.

## Use Case Example
- Input: User submits a Python function.
- Processing: SmolAgent analyzes the function, adds comments, and generates tests.
- Output: The system returns the commented code along with the tests.

## Technology Stack
- SmolAgents: Lightweight AI agent framework for code analysis, commenting, and test generation.
- Daytona SDK: Provides isolated workspaces for executing Python code securely.
